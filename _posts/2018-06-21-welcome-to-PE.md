Hello There!  

Welcome to Process Eng. blog, the place where I'll share my lessons learnt, tips and observations over many years of my career as a process engineer.  

Most of the posts would be related to the downstream oil and gas engineering, from engineering drawings like PFD & P&ID, equipment sizing,
meetings like HAZOP to technical write-ups such as control narrative and safeguarding memorandum. Since I'm also involved in commissioning
I'll be writing on that area as well (maybe the procedures involved).  

I also plan to incorporate few calculation templates in this blog so stay tuned!  

In the next coming days, I'll be joining one of the largest commisioning works on the planet so my early posts might be around 
commissioning activities and its challenges.  

Thanks for reading. See you in the next post!
