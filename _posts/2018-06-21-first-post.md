Hi there! I'm posting this just before being dispatched to do commissioning at one of the largest downstream oil and gas projects on the planet. I'm sure I'll be learning a thing or two about pre-commissioning, commissioning, and startup, so I plan to share it here. I hope this turns into a long-term thing where I keep sharing what I learn along the way. Thanks for reading, see you in the next post!
